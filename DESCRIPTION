Description: Facilitate text retrieval from feed
    formats like XML (RSS, ATOM) and JSON. Also direct retrieval from
    HTML is supported. As most (news) feeds only incorporate small
    fractions of the original text tm.plugin.webmining even retrieves
    and extracts the text of the original text source.
