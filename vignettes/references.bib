    abstract = {{In addition to the actual content Web pages consist of navigational elements, templates, and advertisements. This boilerplate text typically is not related to the main content, may deteriorate search precision and thus needs to be detected properly. In this paper, we analyze a small set of shallow text features for classifying the individual text elements in a Web page. We compare the approach to complex, state-of-the-art techniques and show that competitive accuracy can be achieved, at almost no cost. Moreover, we derive a simple and plausible stochastic model for describing the boilerplate creation process. With the help of our model, we also quantify the impact of boilerplate removal to retrieval performance and show significant improvements over the baseline. Finally, we extend the principled approach by straight-forward heuristics, achieving a remarkable detection accuracy.}},

@inproceedings{Goog:MapReduce,
    abstract = {MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets.  Users specify a \_map\_ function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a \_reduce\_ function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.  Many real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper. <P> Programs written in this functional style are automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the program's execution across a set of machines, handling machine failures, and managing the required inter- machine communication.  This allows programmers without any experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a large distributed system.  <P> Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation processes many terabytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers find the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce programs have been implemented and upwards of one thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day.     <P>},

@article{Msft:MapReduce,
    abstract = {Google's MapReduce programming model serves for processing large data sets in a massively parallel manner. We deliver the first rigorous description of the model including its advancement as Google's domain-specific language Sawzall. To this end, we reverse-engineer the seminal papers on MapReduce and Sawzall, and we capture our findings as an executable specification. We also identify and resolve some obscurities in the informal presentation given in the seminal papers. We use typed functional programming (specifically Haskell) as a tool for design recovery and executable specification. Our development comprises three components: (i) the basic program skeleton that underlies MapReduce computations; (ii) the opportunities for parallelism in executing MapReduce computations; (iii) the fundamental characteristics of Sawzall's aggregators as an advancement of the MapReduce approach. Our development does not formalize the more implementational aspects of an actual, distributed execution of MapReduce computations.},

@book{PangLee:Opinion,
    abstract = {{An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. The focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. The survey includes an enumeration of the various applications, a look at general challenges and discusses categorization, extraction and summarization. Finally, it moves beyond just the technical issues, devoting significant attention to the broader implications that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services have: questions of privacy, vulnerability to manipulation, and whether or not reviews can have measurable economic impact. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is the first such comprehensive survey of this vibrant and important research area and will be of interest to anyone with an interest in opinion-oriented information-seeking systems.}},

@book{chambers:GuidetoS,
    abstract = {{Here is a thorough and authoritative guide to the latest version of the S language and to its programming environment, the premier software platform for computing with data. Programming with Data describes a new and greatly extended version of S, and is written by the chief designer of the language. The book is a guide to the complete programming process, starting from simple, interactive use and continuing through ambitious software projects.S is designed for computing with data - for any project in which organizing, visualizing, summarizing, or modeling data is a central concern. Its focus is on the needs of the programmer/user, and its goal is "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully." S is a functional, object-based language with a huge library of functions for all aspects of computing with data. Its long and enthusiastic use in statistics and applied fields has also led to many valuable libraries of user-written functions.The new version of S provides a powerful class/method structure, new techniques to deal with large objects, extended interfaces to other languages and files, object-based documentation compatible with HTML, and powerful new interactive programming techniques. This version of S underlies the S-Plus system, versions 5.0 and higher.John Chambers has been a member of the technical staff in research at Bell Laboratories since 1966. In 1977, he became the first statistician to be named a Bell Labs Fellow, cited for "pioneering contributions to the field of statistical computing." His research has touched on nearly all aspects of computing with data, but he is best known for the design of the S language. He is the author or co-author of seven books on S, on computational methods, and on graphical methods; and he is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.}},

@inproceedings{boilerpipe,
    abstract = {{In addition to the actual content Web pages consist of navigational elements, templates, and advertisements. This boilerplate text typically is not related to the main content, may deteriorate search precision and thus needs to be detected properly. In this paper, we analyze a small set of shallow text features for classifying the individual text elements in a Web page. We compare the approach to complex, state-of-the-art techniques and show that competitive accuracy can be achieved, at almost no cost. Moreover, we derive a simple and plausible stochastic model for describing the boilerplate creation process. With the help of our model, we also quantify the impact of boilerplate removal to retrieval performance and show significant improvements over the baseline. Finally, we extend the principled approach by straight-forward heuristics, achieving a remarkable detection accuracy.}},

@book{hadoop,
    abstract = {{Hadoop: The Definitive Guide helps you harness the power of your data. Ideal
for processing large datasets, the Apache Hadoop framework is an open source
implementation of the MapReduce algorithm on which Google built its empire.
This comprehensive resource demonstrates how to use Hadoop to build reliable,
scalable, distributed systems: programmers will find details for analyzing
large datasets, and administrators will learn how to set up and run Hadoop
clusters. Complete with case studies that illustrate how Hadoop solves
specific problems, this book helps you:

Use the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storing large datasets, and
run distributed computations over those datasets using MapReduce Become
familiar with Hadoop's data and I/O building blocks for compression, data
integrity, serialization, and persistence Discover common pitfalls and
advanced features for writing real-world MapReduce programs Design, build, and
administer a dedicated Hadoop cluster, or run Hadoop in the cloud Use Pig, a
high-level query language for large-scale data processing Take advantage of
HBase, Hadoop's database for structured and semi-structured data Learn
ZooKeeper, a toolkit of coordination primitives for building distributed
systems

If you have lots of data -- whether it's gigabytes or petabytes -- Hadoop is
the perfect solution. Hadoop: The Definitive Guide is the most thorough book
available on the subject. "Now you have the opportunity to learn about Hadoop
from a master-not only of the technology, but also of common sense and plain
talk." -- Doug Cutting, Hadoop Founder, Yahoo!}},
